The following is a week-by-week plan for the whole project, that will be updated during project completion. This will include appropriate information on where to find/see any progress and whether or not the actions have been completed or postponed to a following week.

`NOTE: Any notes that have been taken will be featured under the repository` [wiki]()

See the following:

## Winter semester

* **Week 1**:
    1. Break the project description down into actionable steps - ***COMPLETED***

    2. research papers that have been published that have used VizDOOM, and evaluate what hasn't been done yet, or that which can be improved on/further proven. Ensure to take notes of any important concepts and technologies identified while reading, and keep a record of any sources with an appropriate reference manager (e.g. Zotero)
    
    3. Research additional APIs similar to VizDOOM and solidify project directions; i.e. decide if using VizDOOM, finish project plan
    
    4. Create a project repository on GitHub, using the provided template. Ensure to add supervisor to the repository. - ***COMPLETED***

    5. Attend meeting with supervisor, take meeting minutes, and get questions answered. ***COMPLETED***

    6. Research how to implement and use any concepts identified in the notes. ***COMPLETED***

    7. Begin project dissertation - using overleaf. 


* **Week 2: Baseline Model Scaffolding**
    * **Tasks:** 

        1. Install ViZDoom and all required libraries (PyTorch, etc.). Run the provided example scenarios to ensure the environment is working correctly. Familiarize yourself with the ViZDoom API (state/action spaces, rewards).

        2. Implement the basic skeleton of your CNN in PyTorch. Write the code to take a ViZDoom screen buffer (frame) as input and produce a forward pass with action logits as output.

    * **Deliverables:** 
        - A fully functional development environment.
        - A script that can load a ViZDoom frame and process it through your baseline CNN model.

* **Week 3: Scenario Design & Metrics**

    * **Tasks:** Design your first focused evaluation scenario (e.g., the motion interception task). Create the map (`.wad` file) and the configuration (`.cfg` file) in ViZDoom. Formally define the metrics you will use to measure success (e.g., interception rate, reaction time).

    * **Deliverable:** A complete, runnable ViZDoom scenario file and a document defining your evaluation metrics.

* **Week 4: Agent Implementation & Logging**

    * **Tasks:** Implement a simple reinforcement learning agent (e.g., Deep Q-Network). Integrate your baseline CNN into this agent. Set up a robust logging framework (e.g., using `wandb` or `TensorBoard`) and a method for saving configuration files to ensure reproducibility.

    * **Deliverable:** A trainable RL agent that can take actions in your custom scenario.

* **Week 5: Initial Baseline Training**

    * **Tasks:** Begin the first training runs of your baseline agent in the custom ViZDoom scenario. The goal here is not to achieve perfect performance, but to debug the training loop and ensure the agent is learning.

    * **Deliverable:** The agent successfully runs for several thousand episodes without crashing; initial learning curves are logged.

* **Week 6: Full Baseline Training Run**

    * **Tasks:** Conduct the full training run for the baseline ViZDoom agent across multiple random seeds to ensure your results are robust.
    * **Deliverable:** A set of trained model weights for the baseline agent.

* **Week 7: Baseline Evaluation in ViZDoom**

    * **Tasks:** Evaluate the trained baseline agent. Run it in evaluation mode (no learning) for a large number of episodes and log the performance metrics defined in Week 3.
    * **Deliverable:** A table of results showing the baseline agent's performance in your ViZDoom scenario.

* **Week 8: ImageNet Baseline Setup**

    * **Tasks:** Prepare the comparative benchmark. Set up the data pipeline for a subset of ImageNet. Adapt your baseline CNN to perform classification and load a pretrained model for fine-tuning.

    * **Deliverable:** A working script that can train/validate your baseline CNN on ImageNet.

* **Week 9: ImageNet Baseline Training & Evaluation**

    * **Tasks:** Fine-tune and evaluate the baseline CNN on the ImageNet subset.
    * **Deliverable:** A table of results showing the baseline model's top-1 and top-5 accuracy on ImageNet.

* **Week 10: Implement Innovation (Attention Module)**

    * **Tasks:** Code your chosen innovation (e.g., a CBAM attention module) and integrate it into your CNN architecture. Verify the model's forward pass and check that all tensor shapes are correct.

    * **Deliverable:** A new "Attention-CNN" model that is ready for training.

* **Week 11 [PROJECT WEEK]: Innovation Integration & Mid-Project Consolidation**

    * **Tasks:** Integrate the new Attention-CNN into both your ViZDoom RL agent and your ImageNet classification script. Consolidate all baseline results and draft the methodology section for your status report.

    * **Deliverable:** All code is ready for the main experimental runs.

* **Week 12 [PROJECT WEEK]: Analysis & Reporting**
    * **Tasks:** Write and submit your mid-project status report. This report should detail your motivation, the custom scenario you designed, your baseline agent's architecture, and the complete set of baseline performance data from both ViZDoom and ImageNet.

    * **Deliverable:** **Status report submitted.**

### Spring Semester

* **Week 13: Train Attention Agent in ViZDoom (Part 1)**

    * **Tasks:** Begin the full training runs for your new Attention-CNN agent in the ViZDoom scenario across multiple seeds. This is a major experiment and may take time.
    * **Deliverable:** Training runs initiated and logged.

* **Week 14: Train Attention Agent in ViZDoom (Part 2)**

    * **Deliverable:** A summary table comparing the performance of both models across both benchmarks.

* **Week 17: Statistical Testing**

    * **Tasks:** Run statistical tests (e.g., independent t-tests) to determine if the performance difference between the baseline and attention agents is statistically significant in the ViZDoom environment.

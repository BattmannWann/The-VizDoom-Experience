# Week 5, Project Week 5

## October 20th, 2025

**Present**:

- Rhys Stewart 
- Dr. Gerardo Aragon Camarasa (Supervisor)

---

### Achieved in the Current Week:

- Issues with supervisor rectified, resulting in reallocation of supervisor 
- Read seed paper proposed by Dr. Camarasa prior to meeting to gain better understanding of state-of-the-art and current directions within the field of robotics and AI

---

### Notes from the Meeting

- Look into setting up an account with [weights and biases](https://wandb.ai/site/)

- Research question and direction should be better adapted to project focus. 

- Supervisor suggested to complete tutorial(s) on deep learning in relation to PyTorch to ensure solid foundational understanding to aid in project development

- Supervisor suggested to complete tutorial on using Baseline models through [Stable Baselines3](https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3) (Stable Baselines3 (SB3) is a set of reliable implementations of reinforcement learning algorithms in PyTorch)

- Baseline model will likely be PPO 

- Understand what optimiser is best for reinforcement learning. RMT, that which was used in the code for basic understanding, is unstable. Instead consider the likes of the `Adam Optimiser` or that suggested by SB3. 

- Supervisor suggested to read papers on `Active Vision` to better understanding on project focus and how an implementation would be derived

    - Example papers are https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17435, https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01450, and MSCi Paper CORTARIO: Reinforcement Learning with Retino-Cortical Transform Image Pre-processing in Super Mario Bros by Milo Krawiec 

- Supervisor will be unable to attend a meeting between later November to early December, roughly from the 28th of November to the 5th of December

---

### Questions:

- What would be an appropriate focus for my project?

    - Question would now relate to: "What is the effect of having an active sensor in training an RL agent in ViZDoom."

- What time and day would be ideal for a meeting every week?

    - Monday at 12:00 would be the preferred meeting time


---

### Objectives for the Week:

- Find a suitable online tutorial (supervisor suggested YouTube as a place to start) for deep learning using PyTorch, and begin learning. Aim to have this finished by next week latest

- Complete the tutorial on the SB3 repository

- Set up an account for Weights and Biases (essentially wandb.ai) and set up a test example with the basic ViZDoom code

- Read suggested papers, take notes and annotations accordingly

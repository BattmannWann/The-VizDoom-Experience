## Questions:

- How would testing this actually work? For example, on reading papers, it hasn't been particularly intuitive to me as to why they tested things in the way they did. I get the general concept behind it but execution is foreign to me. Furthermore, what metrics would be ideal to track and follow? Currently reward and loss are my current ones.

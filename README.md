# VizDOOM Visual Learning Environment
#### An Individual Project Completed by Rhys Stewart

## Introduction

Welcome to the VizDoom Experience. This repository serves the basis for research, data analysis, and a formal scientific report. 

Before diving into the content or the report, it is important to understand what is being researched here. This will be discussed in the section below, but first some pre-requisite. 

### What is VizDoom?

>A "Doom-based AI reseach platform for reinforcement learning from raw visual information". This project has been developed based off of [ZDOOM](https://zdoom.org/) an "enhanced port of the Doom engine for running on modern operating systems".

This will be the basis of the project, used to answer the proposed research question.

## Purpose and Aims

The purpose of this project is to answer the following research question: "Can VizDoom detect meaningful visual processing improvements that other evaluation methods miss?". 
"Can VisDoom detect meaningful visual processing improvements that static benchmarks miss?"

The evaluation of this would prove the efficiency of VizDoom in computer vision testing and demonstrate its potential as a benchmark. 

To simplify the purpose, essentially this project will try to prove that if a new CNN is developed, it is worthwhile to test using VizDoom compared to other benchmarks by showcasing the performance difference between VizDoom and some of these benchmarks.

Our aims are derived from breaking down this question:
